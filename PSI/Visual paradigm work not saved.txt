I am so sorry for not including the Visual Paradigm project. I have recently bought a new computer with a fresh install of windows and i can not get Visual Paradigm to work on it. I have tried downloading and installing it multiple times but it just crashes every time i open it. I used draw.io instead for my diagrams and i tried to replicate the Visual Paradigm style as closely as i could.
